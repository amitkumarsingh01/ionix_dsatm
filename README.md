# Intoduction 
Harnessing the power of linear actuators and real-time image processing using raspberry pi 5, we engineered a cutting-edge rover (pro-dim bot) capable of dynamically adjusting its size based on detected objects in dual axes. We integrated remote monitoring features accessible through our app and website, enabling users to keep tabs on the rover's activities. Our autonomous rover offers the flexibility of control via both our app and the Fly-Sky remote, giving users the freedom to choose their preferred mode of operation.
